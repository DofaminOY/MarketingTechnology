1. The cost of a weekly subscription to the app is $7.

3% of app installers are expected to choose this subscription option.

The average "life expectancy" of a paid user is 10 weeks (after that the user doesn't renew the subscription anymore).

The coefficient of free (organic) installations is 10% of the total number of installations.
